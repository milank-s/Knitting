I wake up every morning at 5
I'm hungry, my body is still growing
I eat the tin of oats uncooked
I run one hour to the gym
Then one hour on the treadmill
My blood is 60 degrees, my clothes steam
I go to my favourite coffee shop
all my friends come in steaming
there's an orgy of espresso and excitement
for the coming day

our dreams are crisp
sharpened with cortados

we can't wait any longer
we burst out to lift the city up in our swelling craft

10 hours later I'm reminded to stop writing
(my society redefining social contract)
to enjoy a coworkers latest screenplay
friends in the fasion arts and music industrations
throng around the matinee

deeply raptured, deft execution, each scene, dreamlike, brought me to new
realities and realizations, building on each other in a satisfying conclusions
The deepest questions of being ushered themselves forward at intermission
and we engage in socratic dialogue, debating fundamental facts 
of what it means to be alive together
to share this moment and this breath

everyone leaves feeling enriched

returning to work I add these new discoveries
I finish feeling a sense of well being and gratitude towards human kind

I arrive home with nothing to do but sit in the corner and pray. 
for the miracle of life and to complete 100 pushups after each sutra
I fall asleep in orgiastic bliss, needing no longer to delay the coming day
