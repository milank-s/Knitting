a bedsheet
my sweat
a waxy leaf
the window
two pillows
a skin tag
unread books
hair
a mirror
a door


a room
a siren
dawn chorus
the streetlight's shadow
two eyes
a screen


stairs
entrances and exits
a city
a circuit
a song
background radiation
soil horizons
substratum and subway

moving porously
between points of sale
and phone vibrations

a delirium of gates
and vestibules
never arriving

an infinitely deferred
room
