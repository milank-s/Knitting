I sweat through my sheets last night

				could I contain it

what should have been crystalline
			had lost continuity

The urge persisted to perfect it
to break it, 
grab the loose ends
and tangle them up in a impossible knot
that only I could untie


or


to be full

to smooth out all wrinkles


The game now consisted of breaking it in ever more spectular ways. 
The urge persisted to coax its shape into something beautiful. 
To grab the loose ends and tangle them in impossible tapestry.


The urge persisted to cut the knot,
grab the loose ends and weave a tapestry. 

But it could not be severed. 
The game now consisted of tangling it in ever more spectacular ways.
